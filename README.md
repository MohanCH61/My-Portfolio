# 🧑‍💻 My Portfolio – Mohan Cheekatla

Welcome to my personal **portfolio website** — a place where I showcase my projects, skills, and journey as a developer.  
This site reflects not just my technical abilities but also my passion for creating clean, responsive, and meaningful web experiences.

## 🚀 About This Project
This is my **personal portfolio website** built completely from scratch using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.  
It highlights my **skills, projects, and services**, and includes a **contact form** powered by **EmailJS**, so anyone can reach me directly.

The goal was to design something minimal, elegant, and easy to navigate — a true digital reflection of who I am as a developer.
